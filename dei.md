# DEI 

Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging are fundamental to achieving our mission at Leighton Avant-Garde Haus. We know that systemic racism, poverty and discrimination negatively impact the overall health and wellness of our communities. It is our responsibility to take action.

By respecting and understanding cultural differences, we enhance our ability to provide culturally sensitive involvement. Increasing cultural competence starts with understanding our own biases and shifting our approach when we interact with others who may be different from ourselves. This reduces the potential for physical, emotional or psychological harm to those who entrust us. 

We are accountable to our employees and people who live in the communities we serveâ€”of all races, ethnicities, gender identities, sexualities, abilities and economic means.
